# Report.
## Here the input to this program, are three dimensional coordinates (x, y, z).
## From the problem specification, coordinates are limited between [-10, 10]. Due to this
## specification, the maximum distance between the points that can occur is [-34.641, 34.641].
## The program calculates the distance between each cell, and then sorts the distances using the bucket sort algorithm.
## Here I am using OpenMP to complete the program.
